# Lock-Smith

Lock-Smith is a simple web application that allows users to store and retrieve website passwords locally. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing passwords without the need for an internet connection or server-side storage.

## Features

- **Password Storage**: Users can input the website name and password into the form and submit them to be stored locally.
- **Password Retrieval**: Users can search for a password by entering the website name in the search field and clicking the "Search" button.
- **Clear Saved Data**: Users can clear all saved passwords by clicking the "Clear Saved Data" button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
- CSS: Styles the HTML elements for better presentation and user experience.
- JavaScript: Enables dynamic functionality such as form submission handling, local storage manipulation, and table population.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the website name and password into the form fields.
3. Click the "Submit" button to save the password.
4. To search for a saved password, enter the website name into the search field and click the "Search" button.
5. To clear all saved passwords, click the "Clear Saved Data" button.

## Local Storage

The passwords are stored locally using the `localStorage` API provided by modern web browsers. This means that the passwords are only accessible from the same browser and device where they were saved.
